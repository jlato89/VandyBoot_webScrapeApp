# VandyBoot_webScrapeApp
Vanderbilt Bootcamp - Week 18 assignment

## What this app does
This app is meant to scrape data from a remote news site and display the articles to the homepage. It uses Axios and Cheerio to grab the data and store it on a mongodb database, then the homepage pulls the info from the DB to display. It also has comment functionality.
Most of the magic is done in the backend and not much work was done to the styling aspect of this homework.
